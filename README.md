## About the Project:
EduHost is a website hosting platform for students to be able to showcase their projects and portfolios online in their own websites. The platform will allow students to sign up, and use the embedded tools to both build and deploy their own websites to build their online presence, all within the EduHost web application. The aim of EduHost is to cater for all students, regardless of their ability to code. They can use the built-in project website builder, or upload their own website files they coded themselves.
